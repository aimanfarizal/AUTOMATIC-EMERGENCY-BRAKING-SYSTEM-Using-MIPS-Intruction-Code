Our title is Automatic Emergency Braking System. 

To simulate this project, we use 3 Sensors and 3 actuators.
SENSORS
1. Radar: To know the distance with obstacles in front.
2. Wheel Speed Sensor: To know the current speed of the car.
3. Camera: To identify the obstacle (eg: vehicle, hazard, pedestrian, traffic light).
   
ACTUATORS
1. Dashboard Indicator: Alert the driver, ready for emergency brake.
2. Brake: To stop or reduce the velocity of the car
3. Rear Emergency Brake Light: Give warning to other drivers.
